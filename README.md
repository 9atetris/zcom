# ZKom

We are building ZKOM, a decentralized framework for verifiable off-chain AI computations with zero-knowledge proofs. Leveraging Starknet and Cairo, it enables trusted AI computation results without re-execution, solving challenges in scalability, privacy, and blockchain-AI integration.

With ZKOM, users can:

1. **Verify AI Computations Without Re-execution**: By generating ZKPs for AI inference processes, ZKOM ensures results are trustworthy without requiring re-computation, making it highly efficient and secure.
2. **Protect Privacy**: Users and organizations can verify results without exposing sensitive data, enabling privacy-preserving use cases such as **ZK KYC** (Zero-Knowledge Know Your Customer) or confidential AI model validation.
3. **Run a Node to Provide Computational Power**: The system is decentralized, allowing users to run their own nodes to contribute computational power to the prover.
4. **Decentralized Proof Verification**: Third parties can use the computation results by simply verifying the proofs. They do not need to perform the calculations themselves, as the proof guarantees the integrity and correctness of the results.

This decentralized approach ensures transparency, security, and accessibility for a wide range of applications.
